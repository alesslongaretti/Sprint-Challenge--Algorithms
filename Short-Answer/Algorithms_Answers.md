#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 0(n). The loop runs 0(n) times and does O(1) work for that iteration. We drop the constant and are left with 0(n).


b) 0 (n ^ 2) because it is a loop within a loop. or O(n log(n)).


c) 0(n) this is often called linear. Its being called recursively.

## Exercise II

I would first start on the middle of the building to check if the egg will break. If it does, I will check the middle of the floors below. If they don't, then I will check the middle of the floors above to find the value of F. Runtime complexity O(log n ).
